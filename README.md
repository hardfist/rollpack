# unpack (Build Your Own Bundler)
Unplugin API built on top of Webpack architecture

A miniature model of the bundler, intended to teach the structure of the real bundler.

I realized a small bundler implementation would be useful to others who want to learn how bundler works. So I will rewrite the Rspack in Rust with minimal api(unplugin api),it will contain 1/10 functionalities of the real Rspack bundler. It's intended as a reference in code for people who want to see how bundler actually works without the consideration of performance and huge api.
